            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If a diſſeiſor, &amp;c. who hath a defeaſible title in a Mannor, grant a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary eſtate by Coppy (being forfeited, or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheated to him) this grant ſhall not binde him that hath right, after a recontinuance of the Mannor, but admittances, which a diſſeiſor, &amp;c. makes to Coppy holds, are good, for they are in a manner judiciall acts, and ſhall binde the diſſeiſee. 4.

That 'twas no perfect revocation by the Indenture of 20. <hi>Sept.</hi> till the Deed were inrolled in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; for though that the <hi>proviſo</hi> of revocation in the firſt Indenture ſhall be ſatisfied with an inrollment, in any of the Kings Courts, yet for that the Indenture of revocation it ſelfe, limits the revocation to take effect, after the inrollment in Chancery, it ought to be ſo. 4. That the Fine levied before the inrollment in Chancery (which was before the revocation) hath extinct the power; ſee <hi>Albaines</hi> caſe before adjudged, and <hi>Popham</hi> Chiefe Juſtice ſaid, that without queſtion ſuch a power might be releaſed, for 'tis not meerely collaterall, but ſavours and taſtes of the eſtate of the land, which all the Court agreed. 5. If the Fine had not been, the auncient uſes were determined, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entry or claime, becauſe he himſelfe was tenant for life of the land, and the act of revocation is as ſtrong as claime; and this point was agreed in the Earle of Salops caſe. 6.

Note for Elections theſe diverſities. 1. When nothing paſſes to the grantee, &amp;c. before Election, there it ought to be made, in the life of the Parties; but when the Eſtate paſſes preſently, &amp;c. the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, &amp;c his Heire or Executor may elect. 2. When the ſame thing paſſes and the Donee, &amp;c. hath Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in what manner, &amp;c. he will take it, the Donee, Heire, or Executor may elect. 3. When Election is given to ſeverall perſons, the firſt ſhall ſtand. 4. When Election is given of two ſeverall things, he which ought to doe the firſt Act, ſhall have Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 5. When the thing granted is annuall, and to have continuance, there the Election remaines to the Grantor (in caſe, where the Law gives him E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection) as well after the day as before, otherwiſe tis when the thing is to be performed, <hi>

Though the Leſſees here enter generally, yet they may Elect after; ſo, if one be Executor, and Deviſee of a terme, and enters gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, &amp;c. and after the Leſſees, in the principall caſe, made Election, for to take by bargaine and Sale, and had the Rents.</p>

And therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeciall matter ſhewing, it ſhall not be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he hath any Lawfull diſcharge, and in favour of the Holy Church (although it may have a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full comencement) the Law will not ſuffer this preſcription <hi>In non decimando,</hi> to put it to the Tryall of lay men, which ſooner will ſtraine their conſcience for their private benefit, then render to the Church the duty which belongeth to it.</p>
               <p>A ſpirituall perſon that was capable of Tythes at the common Law in pernancy may preſcribe to be diſcharged of Tythes generally, or to have a portion of Tythes in the Land of another.</p>

Attourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a lawfull act: if one joyntenant aſſigne Dower, 'tis good. Alſo, the attornement paſſes no intereſt from him that attournes, but perfects the grant of another. And if one joyntenant give ſeiſure of rent that ſhall binde the other, but in a <hi>quid juris clamat,</hi> or <hi>quem redditum reddit,</hi> or <hi>per quae ſervitia,</hi> one joyntenant ſhall not be permitted to attourne without his companion, for doing of prejudice to his companion. By <hi>Popham</hi> one joynt-tenant, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice another in the perſonalty, but not in the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if one take all the profits, or releaſe a perſonall action, the other hath no remedy, becauſe of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and truſt betweene them, and the folly imputed to him, to joyne with ſuch a companion.</p>

               <p>In this Caſe is ſhewed when this word (proviſo) or (provided) maketh a condition, and when not,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42741:32"/> which upon long debate was judged by all the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of England.</p>
               <p>It was adjudged that the Law hath not appointed any place in a deed or inſtrument, proper or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to a condition, but in what place it pleaſeth the parties, and this word (proviſo or provided) is as apt a word to make an eſtate conditionall, as <hi>Sub conditione,</hi> or any other word of condition, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding when this word proviſo maketh an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate or intereſt conditionall, three things are to be obſerved. Firſt that the proviſo doe not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another ſentence nor participate thereof, but ſtand originally of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the proviſo be the word of the bargainor, Feoffor, Donor, Leſſor, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it be compulſory to enforce the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganee, Feoffee, Donee, Leſſee, &amp;c. to doe an act, and where theſe concurre, it was reſolved, that it was a condition, in what place ſoever it be placed, for <hi>Cujus eſt dare ejus eſt diſponere.</hi> And although words of Covenant be contained in the ſame clauſe of the proviſo it ſelfe, yet (the proviſo being in judgement of <hi>Law</hi> a word of condition) it ſhall not looſe his force, and ſo it hath beene judged, In <hi>Symſon et Titterell,</hi> 26. <hi>El.</hi> Serjeant <hi>Bendlowes</hi> demyſed to <hi>Titterell</hi> certaine Lands in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> for forty yeares, provided alwayes, and it is Covenanted and agreed betweene the ſaid Parties, That the <hi>Leſſee,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould not alien, and this was adjudged a condition, by force of the proviſo, and a Covenant alſo, by force of th'other words. Alſo it was adjudged in <hi>Banco Regis</hi> 36. <hi>El.</hi> betweene the Earle of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe, and Sir <hi>Henry Barkely</hi> Defendant. The Earle granted the Office of the Lievtenant-ſhip of the Weſt part of the Forreſt of <hi>Fronſlewood,</hi> in Com. <hi>Somerſet,</hi> to Sir <hi>Mawrice Barkely,</hi> Father of the ſaid
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42741:33"/> Sir <hi>Henry</hi> in Taile; provided alwayes and the ſaid Sir <hi>Mawrice Barkeley</hi> for him, &amp;c. doth Covenant to, and with the ſaid Earle, that neyther he the ſaid Earle nor any of his Heires Males, &amp;c. ſhall cut downe any Wood growing upon any part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. And it was reſolved by all the Juſtices of England, upon argument before them at Serjants Inne, that although the proviſo was coupled with the expreſſe Covenant of the Grantee, and every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be created by the words of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Donor, Feoffor, &amp;c. yet in judgement of Law, this word (provided) was a condition created by the Grantor, although all the reſidue of the ſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be the words of the Grantee, for (proviſo) being an apt word of a condition, the ſame ſentence containeth the words of the Grantor, purporting a condition, and the words of the Grantee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending a Covenant.</p>
               <p>This word (proviſo) when it dependeth upon another ſentence, or hath reference to another part of the deed, doth not make a condition, but a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or limitation of the ſentence or part of the deed, to which it is referred. As in a Leaſe without impeachment of waſt, provided that he ſhall not doe voluntary waſt, grant of a Rent charge, provided that the Grantee ſhall not charge the Grantor, &amp;c. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that B. ſhall have the Rent, notwithſtanding that before the <hi>Reddendum,</hi> the uſe in Fee was veſted by the recovery in A. and notwithſtanding 'twas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that the Rent ought to be limitted out of the Eſtate of the Recoverors, for 27 H. 8. hath an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe clauſe, Where diverſe be ſeiſed, to the intent, that one ſhall have an annuall Rent, the ſame perſon be adjudged in poſſeſſion, and ſeiſin of the ſame rent, as if a ſufficient grant had beene made, and ſo here the intent, being that B. ſhould have the Rent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction

Becauſe by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Covenant 'tis declared, that all aſſurances after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be made, ſhould be to the uſes and intents in the ſame Indenture, and to no other; and the Indenture intends that the condition ſhould be ſaved as the Lord releaſes all his right in the Land, ſaving his Rent. <hi>Putnams</hi> Caſe, 4. 5. P. and M. Dyer: Feoffement of a Mannor rendring Rent, and a reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and a Covenant by any Indenture to Leavy a fine, which ſhould be to the uſes and intents of the firſt Indenture, and to no other uſe, which was leavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according, with the uſuall words of releaſe of all his right, yet, reſolved that neither the Rent, nor the condition was deſtroyed, and 23. of the Queene, <hi>Tuſſers</hi> Caſe, a rent reſerved by a fine before, was not deſtroyed by a common recovery, and generall entry into warranty, and 34. of the Queene in <hi>Clever</hi> and <hi>Childs</hi> Caſe, adjudged according to <hi>Putnams</hi> Caſe: for the ſame reaſon twas adjudged in this Caſe, 14. of the Queene, for the Advouſon of <hi>Alexton,</hi> for, <hi>Modus et conventio vincunt legem,</hi> and Covenant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the parties hath power. Firſt, to raiſe a uſe. Secondly, to declare uſes upon fines, recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. Thirdly, for to preſerve Rents and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and for to direct recoveries, fines, &amp;c. and the ſaving may be contained in another deed, delivered at the ſame time. And theſe common aſſurances, as fines, and recoveries, are to be conſtrued, according to the intent and common uſage, without prying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them with Eagles eyes. Alſo, here the Bargaine, &amp;c. recovery, &amp;c, fine. &amp;c. though made at ſeverall times, yet, all by mutuall agreement, are but one aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, and tend for to perfect a bargaine, &amp;c. and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42741:34"/> therefore the one ſhall not deſtroy the other, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that except in ſpeciall caſes a fine, <hi>Sur grant &amp; render,</hi> cannot be averred by word to another uſe, then is in the fine, feoffement, &amp;c. yet in ſome caſes, it may be ruled in part by averrement, by word, when the originall contract is by deed; but a man may by word averre another conſideration, which ſtands with the conſideration expreſſed, but not againſt it: Reade the Booke at large for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that by the death of A. the condition was broken, for when the Feoffee or Grantee is to doe an act to the Feoffor, &amp;c. upon condition, and no time is limitted, regularly, the Feoffee may doe it at any time during his life. If the Feoffor or Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor doe not haſten the ſame by requeſt, and upon requeſt and day or time limitted, the Feoffee or Grantee ought to doe it accordingly: and if no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt be made, and the Feoffee or Grantee that ought to performe the condition dye, the condition is broken. Yet, this generall rule admits an excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for, here in caſe of an advowſon, he hath not time during his life, though no requeſt be made, but upon contingency, to wit, if no avoydance fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the meane time, for if the Grantee ſtay till the avoydance fall <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> the condition is broken, for B. cannot have all the preſentations during his life, which was the effect of the grant, and the Advowſon is come into another plight then twas. But where the day is certaine for the performance, and the party dye before, the condition is diſcharged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the performance is become impoſſible by the Act of God, and therefore when a day certaine is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, tis good that the Heire of the feoffee be named in the condition. Another diverſity was alſo agreed, when tis to be performed to a ſtranger, he ought to requeſt the ſtranger in convenient time
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42741:34"/> for to limit a time when it ſhall be done, but if it be to the Feoffor himſelfe, he ought not to performe it, before requeſt. Another diverſity was taken by ſome, when the feoffee dyes, and when the feoffor dyes, for in the one caſe the condition is broken, in the other not.</p>

               <p>By the Court, Debt doth well lye in this caſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Leſſee, there are three privities. 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the eſtate onely. 2. Of contract onely. 3. Of eſtate and contract together.

               <p>Firſt, becauſe the Leſſee himſelfe cannot prevent the Leſſor of his remedy; but when the Leſſor grants his reverſion againſt his owne grant, he ſhall not have remedy, becauſe the Rent is incident to the reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Leſſee might grant it to a poore man, not able to manure the Land, or for malice, will ſuffer it to lye freſh, ſo the Leſſor ſhall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy, if Debt ſhould not lye againſt the firſt Leſſee.</p>

               <p>If a leſſor enter for condition broken, or if a leſſee ſurrender to the leſſor, yet the leſſor may have an action of Debt, for arrerages due before the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on broken, or the ſurrender, and this is in reſpect of the contract betweene the leſſor and the leſſee. 36. of the Queene, <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Reſolved, Firſt, Upon the reaſon of the common Law, the refuſall ſhall not have ſuch relation that the deviſe ſhall be good, for the intire Mannor of T. for a relation is a fiction of Law, to make a nullity of a thing <hi>Ab initio,</hi> to one certaine intent, which in truth had being, and that <hi>Propter neceſſitatem, ut res magis valeat, quam pereat.</hi> 11. <hi>E.</hi> 3. The Law will make a nullity <hi>Ab initio,</hi> that the Wife ſhall have dower, but not as to a collaterall intent, as if the reverſion were granted of the Lands which the Husband and Wife held in taile, and the Wife for to have Dower diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, yet the grant is good, for ſhee may be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed though the grant ſtand; and <hi>Relatio eſt fictio juris, et intenta ad unum:</hi> And though relations aide acts in Law, as Dower, yet twill never aide the acts of the party, to avoyd them by relation, as a man infeoffes an Infant, or Feme covert, and after gives, &amp;c. or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes the Land, or any thing out of it, the Infant or Husband diſagrees, this ſhall have relation betwixt the parties, that the Infant or Husband, ſhall not be charged in damages, but ſhall not make the voyd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, &amp;c. good. A Leaſe for life, the remainder to the King, the King grants his remainder, the deed is in-rolled, it ſhall have relation to make this paſſe <hi>Ab ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> to the King, not to make the voyd pattent good. And as relations extend onely to the ſame thing, and the ſame intent, ſo, alſo to the ſame parties, not for to prejudice a Stranger, feoffement of a Mannor, and a long time after livery, the Tenants attourne, this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42741:44"/> ſhall have relation, to make the ſervices paſſe <hi>Ab initio</hi> or otherwiſe they could never paſſe, nor be parcell of the Mannor, but not for to charge the Tenants for the arrerages in the meane time. So here, the refuſall ſhall relate as to the mannor, of H. onely, not to T. and to the wife onely, but not to prejudice the Heire (upon whom part of the Mannor of T. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended) to make the deviſe good for the third part, which was voide at the time of the death: For, <hi>Omne teſtamentum morte conſummatum eſt,</hi> and as it was at the death, ſo it ſhall remaine. Reſolved, that after the Statute of 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and before the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Mannor of T. was not deviſable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the deviſor hath not purſued the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which the Acts of 32. &amp; 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. gives, twas voide for part.</p>
               <p>The firſt branch he hath not purſued, which ſaith, <hi>(That all, &amp;c. having a ſole eſtate in fee ſimple, in any Mannors, &amp;c. ſhall have full and free liberty, &amp;c. to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by his laſt will in writing, as much of, &amp;c. as ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to the cleere yearely value of two parts in three to be divided)</hi> For he had not the Mannor of H. for his Wife had it joyntly with him. See many excellent Caſes in the Booke at large, adjudged upon this word <hi>(Having)</hi> in the Statutes, the <hi>Initium</hi> of a Will ought to be full and perfect, which is the writing, and therefore, if the deviſor command one to write his Will, and he deviſes white Acre to A. and his Heires, and black Acre to B. and his Heires, and dyes, before the deviſe to B. is written, yet the deviſe to A. is good. But if he deviſes to A. &amp;c. upon condition, and he writes the deviſe, and the Teſtator dyes before the Writing of the condition, tis voyd, for in the one caſe, the deviſes are ſeverall, and the one is perfect, in the other Caſe tis maimed, and imperfect, for the intire deviſe, was not fully put in writing, ſo twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42741:44"/> in the Caſe at Barre, that neither the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement nor the end of the Will was full or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for at the time of writing of it, and at the death of the deviſor, he had no power in reſpect of the joynt eſtate in H. to diſpoſe all the Mannor of T. which amounts to the value of two parts of all. Alſo, upon the firſt Branch he ought to have a ſole eſtate, and here his Wife is joyntly ſeiſed with him, and ſhee cannot diſagree during coverture. The Statute gives liberty to him, for to deviſe two parts by will, but this is to be intended of ſuch Land, which he might convey by act executed, but, here by reaſon of the undivided eſtate of the Wife, he cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it but during coverture. Alſo, the third part of <hi>cleere yearly value</hi> is ſaved to the King, and the intent of the Statute was, that the King ſhall have the equall benefit at leaſt for his third part, as the deviſee hath for two parts, but here the deviſee had two parts ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and the King but a poſſibility, <hi>Viz.</hi> If the Wife would diſagree which is at her pleaſure, and this Statute hath been conſtru'd, that equality ſhould be obſerved. A man which held three Mannors of three Lords, could not deviſe two of them, but two parts of every one; upon theſe words <hi>(Cleere yearly value)</hi> 'twas ſaid that of Inheritances, which are not of any yearly value, ſome are deviſable, ſome not, as, <hi>Bona et catalla felonum, fugit,</hi> or <hi>utlagat.</hi> Fines, amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, within ſuch a Mannor or Towne, theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deviſed, nor left to diſcend, but a <hi>Leete, Waife,</hi> or <hi>Stray,</hi> or other hereditament appendant, or appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to a Mannor, paſſe by deviſe of the Mannor with th'appurtenances as incidents, and the Statute had no intent for to diſmember theſe things, which by lawfull preſcription had beene united. But if a hundred, with goods of Fellons, Outlaws, Fines, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciaments,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42741:45"/> returne of Writts, and ſuch other caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hereditaments, within the ſame hundred, have beene accuſtomably demiſed for a yearely rent, they may be deviſed within the purview of the ſaid Act. 'Twas ſaid upon the words of the Statute, which ſays, that he may deviſe a rent common, &amp;c. <hi>Out of two parts,</hi> that a deviſe of a rent of the full value out of all is voyd, but out of two parts 'tis good. And 'twas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that upon 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. a devile of all his land, had beene good for two parts, as adjudged in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntons</hi> Caſe, for Land is ſeverable, but a rent is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. onely gives authority for to deviſe it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond branch which ſpeakes of diviſion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfied, for, during his life, he himſelfe could not <hi>(Set it out)</hi> and after his death, it ſurvives to the Wife. The third and fourth branch is not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this word <hi>(immediatly)</hi> for till diſagreement, without queſtion the Mannor of H. ſurvived to the Wife, and if an Office had beene found before diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, without doubt, the Queene ſhould have a third part of the Mannor of T. and the deviſe being voyd at the death of the deviſor, &amp; the third part law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully veſted in the Heire by diſcent, it cannot be made good and deveſted by a ſubſequent diſagreement. <hi>Littleton,</hi> diſcent to the Heire of Tenant by the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy of a diſſeiſſoreſſe, doth not take away entry, for the Heire comes not in immediatly, &amp; 'twas agreed if a man deviſes two acres holden by Knights ſervice, and a reverſion upon a Leaſe for life diſcends to the heire, this is no immediate diſcent within the Statute, but the third part of the two ought to diſcend; ſee many excellent Caſes of deviſes adjudged upon the Statute.</p>

               <p>Another good Caſe of relations, <hi>Jennings</hi> and <hi>Braggs</hi> Caſe, a diſſeiſee makes an Indenture purporting a Leaſe for yeares, and delivers it to a ſtranger, out of the Land, as an Eſcroule, and commands him for to enter, and deliver this as his deed, to the Leſſee, who doth it, and adjudged a good Leaſe, and this diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty agreed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When the perſon at the firſt delivery hath not ability, to make the contract, and before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond delivery hath, 'tis voyd, as an Infant, and a Fème covert; otherwiſe, when at firſt delivery, the perſon hath ability, but cannot perfect it, till an impediment removed, which is done before the ſecond delivery, there 'tis good, as at Barre.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, ſecondly, that to ſome intent the ſecond delivery ſhall have relation to the former, by fiction of Law, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t res magis valeat quam pereat,</hi> as if a Feme ſole deliver a Leaſe as an eſcroule, and after takes Husband or dyes, yet by the ſecond delivery 'tis a good deed <hi>Ab initio;</hi> and to ſome intent <hi>

Alſo, that the Father ſhall not have the cuſtody of his daughter and heire, for it ought to be ſuch an heire, as ſhall continue ſole and apparent heire; as the Father ſhall not have the cuſtody of the youngeſt ſonne, in Borough Engliſh, for tenure in Chivalry.

So the Court reſolved here, the Mother could not be gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian in Socage, if the land had deſcended to the daughter, nor by nurture, becauſe ſhe was above 14. but the common Law gives remedy againſt a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as aforeſaid. Reſolved, here the Mother ſhall have the cuſtody within the proviſion of the Act, which hath ordained two new manners of cuſtodies. 1. By reaſon of nature. 2.

               <p>Reſolved, though ſhe departed out of the houſe ſixe houres before the contract, yet, in judgement of Law, the Mother had the cuſtody at the time of the contract; for, 'tis inſeperably annexed to the perſon of the Mother.</p>

               <p>Reſolved, that the husband and wife damſell, had good title upon this verdict, againſt the other daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for, by theſe words <hi>(to the next of kin, to whom the inheritance ſhould,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>come after her deceaſe during the life of ſuch perſon, who ſhall ſo contract,</hi> &amp;c.) it ſeemes the daughter ſhall not have the forfeiture, for though ſhe be of the blood, yet, if M. dye, her iſſue ſhall have the land, if without iſſue, the Mother in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>To the objection, that the Mother cannot have it, for ſhe is not of the blood of the daughter, but <hi>econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra.</hi> Father, or Mother, are not next, to whom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration ſhall be granted; and land ſhall eſcheate, rather then it ſhall goe to Father, or Mother.</p>
               <p>Reſolved often againſt 5. <hi>E.</hi> 6. that the Father, or Mother, are next to whom adminiſtration may be granted, and <hi>Littleton</hi> ſays that the Father is neerer of blood, then the Uncle, and therefore the Father ſhall have a remainder limitted to the next of blood of the Sonne, but he ſhall not have an inheritance by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, from the Sonne, for a <hi>Maxime</hi> prohibits it. And 'twas ſaid at barre, if he in reverſion had been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the halfe blood, he might have entered, as <hi>Proximus de ſanguine,</hi> yet none of the halfe blood could inherit.

And with this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agrees 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. upon the ſame Statute of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that this warranty was out of the intent of the Act, which onely reſtraines warranty, which prejudices the heire in taile, or thoſe in remainder, but when the warranty, &amp;c. of the wife, is but for to perfect and corroborate the eſtate aſſured by the iſſue himſelfe, &amp;c. 'tis not reſtrained by the Act, for it ſhall be intended to the benefit of the heire, which is the reaſon, that a common recovery is not reſtrained

               <p>Reſolved, when the firſt iſſue diſables himſelfe, for to take advantage of the forfeiture, and dyes, his iſſue ſhall never take benefit of it, becauſe, he was not <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> nor had the immediate intereſt at the time; and this was Sir <hi>George Brownes caſe</hi> before, where the iſſue in taile in the life of his Mother, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in ſpeciall taile, levied a Fine, without procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; and here, if error were in the recovery, the warranty barres him of his action, becauſe he himſelfe by his own act, hath barred his entry.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42741:50"/> ſhall take advantage of it; for entry upon this Act of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. is not like entry upon the Statute of 6. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>ca'.</hi> 6.

               <p>Reſolved, if tenant in taile, in of another eſtate, ſuffer a common recovery, and a collaterall aunceſtor releaſes with warranty to the recoveror, after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveror makes a Feoffement to uſes, which are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the Statute of 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and the aunceſtor dyes, though the eſtate be transferred in the <hi>poſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſcent of the warranty, yet, it ſhall binde, and the terr-tenants ſhall Rebutt.

But if a man make a Leaſe for yeares, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring rent upon condition, if the rent be not paid to reenter.

               <p>If the Leſſor diſtraine for the rent, for which the demand was made, he hath affirmed the Leaſe; for after the determination of the Leaſe, he may not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine for rent.</p>
               <p>It was alſo reſolved, that as well in caſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition annexed to the rent, as in caſe of a condition annexed to any collaterall act, if the concluſion of the condition be, that then the Leaſe for yeares ſhall be voyd, there no acceptance of the rent due at any day after the breach of the condition will make the voyd Leaſe good.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that as a voidable Leaſe cannot be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by word, for money, &amp;c. ſo the acceptance of a rent which is not <hi>In eſſe,</hi> nor due to him which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts it, doth not affirme the Leaſe as a gift to a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, and to the Heires of the body of the Husband, the Husband dyes, the iſſue accepts the rent of the Leſſee of the Husband, during the life of the Wife, the Wife dyes, yet the iſſue ſhall avoyd the Leaſe, for no rent was due.</p>
               <p>And there is a diverſity betweene a Leaſe for life, and for yeares, in caſe of a leaſe for life, though the concluſion of the condition be, that it ſhall be voyd, yet acceptance of a rent due after the breach, ſhall affirme it, for the freehold being created by livery, cannot be determined before entry. If the ſucceſſor accept the rent upon a Leaſe for yeares of a Parſon, Vicar, Prebend, 'tis worth nothing, for 'tis voyd by

               <p>
                  <hi>Note (Reader)</hi> it ſeemes to me, if upon a Leaſe for life, the Leſſor accepts the ſame rent which was demanded, he hath affirmed the Leaſe, for he cannot accept it, as due upon any contract, as upon a Leaſe for yeares, for when he accepts it, he cannot have an action of Debt for it, but his remedy was by Aſſiſe, if he had ſeiſin or by diſtreſſe, but after reentry he may have an action of Debt.</p>
               <p>If he that hath a rent ſervice, or rent charge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the rent due at the laſt day, and therfore makes an acquittance, all the arrerages due before, are thereby diſcharged, and ſo it hath beene adjudged, <hi>In Hopkins &amp; Mortons</hi> Caſe 10. <hi>El.

               <p>If the Lord accepts the rent or ſervice of the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, he loſes the arrerages in the time of the Feoffor, though he makes no acquittance, for, after ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, he ſhall not avow upon the Feoffor at all, nor upon the Feoffee, but for the arrerages which incurred in his time; otherwiſe, where the Feoffor dyes, and there is ſuch an acceptance.

If a Woman intituled to have Dower (which is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in Law) by covin, cauſes a ſtranger to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſe the terretenant, to the intent to bring Dower a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and recovers accordingly, 'tis all voyd. So if a Feme covert, or Infant (much favoured in Law) of covin, cauſes another to diſſeiſe the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuee, and infeoffe them; they are not remitted. Sale in Market overt ſhall not binde, if the Vendee had notice that the property was to another, or if the Sale be by covin; the Law hath ordained the common Bench as a Market overt, for aſſurance of Land by fine; for it ſayth, <hi>Finis finem litibus imponit,</hi> yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin ſhall avoyd them: A <hi>Vacat</hi> was made in <hi>Banco</hi> of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42741:54"/> a recovery had by covin, 33 &amp; 34. of the Queene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, where Tenant for life levyed a fine with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and five yeares paſſed, and he dyed, that the Leſſor ſhall have five yeares after his death, for though the Statute ſaves the right which <hi>Firſt ſhall grow,</hi> and the right firſt accrued to the Leſſor, by the forfeiture, yet becauſe the Leſſor by covin of the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, might be barred, for he expected not to enter, till after the death of the Leſſee, 'tis no barre, and namely, when the Leſſee hath Land of Inheritance in the ſame Towne, (as in this caſe) ſo, 'twas agreed in the ſame caſe, if the Feoffee of the Leſſee for life hath Lands in the ſame Towne, and levys a fine, &amp;c. the Leſſor ſhall have five yeares after the death of the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, for he knew not of what land the fine was levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (not being party to the Indenture or agreement) &amp;c. So, the Judges have conſtrued the act againſt the Letter, for Salvation of the Inheritance of him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. And 'twas ſaid, if the Feoffee of a Leſſee for yeares, who made a feoffement by practiſe, hath Land in the ſame Ville, and levy a fine, and the Leſſee payes the rent to the Leſſor, it ſhall not binde, and in the principall caſe, the payment of the rent after the fine, makes the fraud apparant, for by this the Leſſor was ſecure, and not cauſe of any doubt of fraud.</p>
               <p>But 'twas reſolved, if the Bargainee or Feoffee of A. perceiving that C. hath right, levies a fine, or takes a fine of a Stranger, to the intent, to barre C. this fine levyed by conſent ſhall binde, for nothing was done in this, that was not lawfull, and the intent of the act was to avoyd ſtrife. So, if A. (pretending title) diſſeiſe B. and to the intent to barre the diſſeiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, levies a fine, for the deſſeiſor, <hi>Venit tanquam in arena,</hi> and 'tis not poſſible but the diſſeiſee had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, and if he doth not enter, 'tis his folly. But in the caſe at barre, every one will preſume that the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42741:55"/> fine is levyed of his owne Land, becauſe that he might lawfully doe; and though this conteines more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, then his owne Land, this is uſuall almoſt in all fines; and the covin of the Leſſee is the cauſe of non-claime of the Leſſor, and a man ſhall not take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his owne covin; and here the fraud is the more odious, becauſe of the great truſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Fealty. To the objection, that it ſhould be miſchievous to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd fines, upon ſuch nude averments; 'twas an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it ſhould be a greater miſchiefe, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, if fines levyed by ſuch covin, ſhould binde. And an averrment of fraud may be taken by the Statute of 27. of the Queene, againſt a fine leavyed to ſecret uſes, by fraud, for to deceive Purchaſors. So by the Statute of 13. of the Queene, an averrment may be taken, againſt a fine levyed upon an uſurious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42741:55"/> fraudulent or no, was the Queſtion? and 'twas reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Sir <hi>Thomas Egerton</hi> Keeper of the Great Seale of England, and by the chiefe Juſtices, <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Anderſon,</hi> and all the Court of Star-chamber, that this deed was fraudulent and within the Statute of 13. <hi>El.</hi> And in this Caſe divers things were reſolved.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That this Deed had the markes of fraud, it was generall, and without exception of his apparell, or any thing of neceſſitie, for <hi>doloſus verſatur in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Donor continueth in the poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was made in ſecret, <hi>Et dona clandeſtina ſemper ſunt ſuſpicioſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, it was made hanging the Writ.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, there was truſt betweene the parties, for the Donor was in poſſeſſion and uſed them, and fraud is alwayes apparelled with truſt, and truſt is the cover of fraud.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it was contained in the deed that it was honeſty, truely and <hi>bona fide, Et clauſulae inconſuetae ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per juducunt ſuſpitionem,</hi> and it was reſolved although it was a due debt to <hi>Twyne,</hi> and a good conſideration of the deed, yet it was not within the proviſo of the ſaid Act of 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> By which it is provided that the ſaid Act doth not extend to any eſtate or intereſt in Lands, &amp;c. goods and chattells made upon good conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Bona fide,</hi> for although it be upon good and true conſideration, yet it is not <hi>Bona fide,</hi> for no deed ſhall be deemed to be made <hi>Bona fide</hi> within the ſaid proviſo that is accompanied with any truſt, for the proviſo ſaith upon good conſideration, and <hi>Bona fide,</hi> ſo as good conſideration doth not ſerve, if it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Bona fide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore (good Reader) if any deed be made to thee in ſatisfaction of any debt, by one that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted unto others alſo. Firſt, let it be in publick
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42741:56"/> manner before Neighbours. Secondly, valued-by good men to a true value. Thirdly, take them out of the poſſeſſion of the Donor preſently, for continuance of poſſeſſion in the Donor is a marke of truſt.</p>
               <p>There are two conſiderations <hi>(Viz.)</hi> Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blood or nature, and valuable conſideration. And if one that is indebted to five ſeverall perſons every one 20. <hi>l.</hi> in conſideration of naturall affection, doth give all his goods unto his Sonne or Coſen. The intention of the Statute was, that the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this caſe ſhould be valuable, for equity requires that this deed that defeates others, ſhall be made of as high a conſideration, as the things are, that are ſo defeated thereby, for it is to be preſumed, that the Father if he had not beene indebted unto others, would not diſpoſſeſſe himſelfe of all his goods, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject himſelfe to his Cradle. And therefore it ſhall be intended that it was to defeate his Creditors. And if a conſideration of nature or blood, ſhould be a good conſideration within this proviſo, the Statute would ſerve for little or nothing, and no creditor ſhould be ſure of his Debt.</p>
               <p>A feoffment made ſolely in conſideration of nature or blood, ſhall not take away the uſe rayſed upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration, but it ſhall take away a uſe rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in conſideration of nature, for both conſiderations are in <hi>Equali jure,</hi> and of the ſame nature.</p>
               <p>Many men marvaile the reaſon that ſo many acts and Statutes are dayly made: this Verſe anſwereth.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Queritur ut crèſcunt tot magna volumina legis.</l>
                  <l>In promptu cauſa creſcit in orbe dolus.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And becauſe fraud abounds in theſe dayes, more then in former times, it was reſolved, that all Statutes made againſt fraud, ſhall be liberally expounded, for to

               <p>It was reſolved, that no purchaſor may avoyd a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent conveyance made by fraud, but he that is a purchaſor for money or other valuable conſideration paid, for conſideration of blood is a good conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not ſuch a conſideration as is intended by the Statute, 27. <hi>El. ca:</hi> 4. for valuable conſideration is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good conſideration by the ſame act. <hi>Anderſon</hi> chiefe Juſtice of the common banck ſaid, That a man who is of ſmall capacity and not able to governe his Lands, that diſcends unto him, and being diſpoſed to ryot and diſorder, by the mediation of his friends, by open Act conveyes his Lands to them, upon truſt and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he ſhall take the profits for his maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and that he ſhall have no power to waſt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them.

               <p>A. Tenant for life, the remainder to B. in taile, the remainder to B. and his heires, B. levies a Fine, hath iſſue, and dyes, before all the Proclamations paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the iſſue then beyond the Sea, the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are made, the iſſue retournes, and upon the land claimes the remainder.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that the eſtate which paſſed, was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42741:57"/> by the death of tenant in taile; ſo, if tenant in taile of a rent, Advowſon, Tythes, Common, &amp;c. grants by Deed, and dyes; for if the iſſue brings a <hi>Formedon</hi> for the rent, he makes the grant voidable, if he diſtraines, or claimes it upon the land, he by this determines his election. And there is no diverſity, betwixt tenant in taile of a rent, &amp;c. and tenant in taile of a reverſion, or a remainder upon an eſtate for life, though in the firſt caſe, the iſſue may have a <hi>Formedon</hi> preſently after the death of tenant in taile.</p>
               <p>Holden by <hi>Popham,</hi> and divers other Juſtices, that the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath inforced the caſe, that the eſtate which paſſes by the Fine of tenant in taile, ſhall not be determined by his death, for by this 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that Fines levied of any lands, &amp;c. intailed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the Fine ingroſſed, and Proclamations made, ſhall be a barre, if the Fine cannot be a barre without continuance, the Statute hath provided, that the eſtate ſhall continue, for it provides for all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary incidents to the perfection, and conſummation of it. Every Fine ſhall be intended with Proclamations, for 'tis moſt beneficiall for the conuſee, and all Fines being the generall aſſurance of land are levied accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that though by the death of tenant in taile, a right of the eſtate taile deſcends to the iſſue, for that the tenant in taile dyed before all the Proclamations paſſed, yet, when they are paſſed, without claime, this right is barred by the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, by all the Judges and Barons (but three) that the iſſue (in this caſe) being heire and privy, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, by any claime, ſave the right of the taile, which is deſcended to him, but that after the Proclamations, he ſhall be barred; for, 'tis provided <hi>(that every Fine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ingroſſing of it, and Proclamation had and made, ſhall be a finall end, and conclude as well privies as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.)</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:42741:57"/> And if no ſaving had been, all ſtrangers had been barred alſo, and all the exceptions extend onely to Strangers, but the iſſue is privy.</p>
               <p>To the objection; if by the equity of the Statutes, the iſſue cannot claime, &amp;c. to what purpoſe are the Proclamations with ſuch ſolemnities?</p>
               <p>Anſwered, 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. being an Act of explanaiton of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. as to the Fine by tenant in taile, ſhall not be taken by any ſtrained conſtruction againſt the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for then 'tis requiſite to have a new Act of expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, upon the explanation, <hi>&amp; ſic in infinitum.</hi> By 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. every one hath liberty to purſue a Fine accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaid Act, <hi>viz.</hi> with proclamations, &amp;c. or without (as at common Law) and therefore the Act of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. of neceſſitie preſcribes that Proclamations ſhall be made according to 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. to diſtinguiſh it from a Fine at common Law, and not to inable the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue for to make claime, for this ſhould be againſt the expreſſe intent of the Act, in the preamble, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. Alſo it ſhould be very inconvenient, if, when ſuch Fine is levied, for a valuable conſideration, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his iſſues, or payment of his debts, and he dyes before Proclamations, that all ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded by the claime of the heire, when the conuſee could not have better aſſurance, by Recovery, for that he was not tenant to the <hi>Praecipe.</hi> See the Booke at large, in what caſe the iſſue in taile may averre ſeiſin in a Stranger, <hi>&amp; quod partes Finis nihil habuerunt,</hi> what not.</p>
               <p>Objected, 1. 'tis provided by the Statute <hi>de donis,</hi> &amp;c. that as to the iſſue, <hi>Finis ipſo jure ſit nullus.</hi> 2. That the Statute of 27. <hi>E.</hi> 1. extends not to the heires in taile, as 8. <hi>H.</hi> 4. is, for the iſſue is not bound by any Record, which inures by way of Eſtoppell. 3. 27. <hi>E.</hi> 1. ſpeakes <hi>De finibus ritè levatis,</hi> and when there wants ſeiſin (which is the eſſence of a Fine) 'tis not <hi>ritè levatus,</hi> 46. <hi>E.</hi> 3. that 'tis a good plea.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:42741:58"/>
               <p>Anſwered, the Statute <hi>de donis,</hi> &amp;c. was made 13. <hi>E.</hi> 1. and the Statute of Fines 27. in which the iſſue is not excepted, therefore he is bound, and according there is a good opinion, 8. <hi>H.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, though the iſſue was not barred of his right before, 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. yet he was eſtopped to ſay, <hi>Quod partes Finis nihil habuerunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the third, <hi>Finis ritè levatus,</hi> is intended in due forme of Law, which it may be, though it be onely by way of concluſion, for the ſame Act ouſts the parties from ſuch averment, and 46. <hi>E.</hi> 3. is to be intended of a collaterall aunceſtor, from whom the heire doth not claime the Land, and then the averment is good.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Conisbies caſe</hi> 'twas reſolved, upon a Fine levied to tenant in taile in remainder, by tenant for life, and a grant and render of a rent, that this was not within the Statutes of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. or 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the Fine was not of the land it ſelfe which was intailed, but of the rent newly created out of the land. And in the Lord <hi>Zouches caſe</hi> 'twas reſolved, that 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. and 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. doe extend to Fines levied by concluſion, and ſhall binde, though <hi>partes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nihil habuerunt;</hi> as if tenant in taile makes a Feoffement, or be diſſeiſed, and levies a Fine, for the Statute ſays, <hi>(All Fines of any lands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in any wiſe intailed to the perſon ſo levying, or to any of his aunceſtors)</hi> and in 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. the exception, <hi>Quod partes,</hi> &amp;c. is <hi>ſaved to all perſons not party, nor privy to the ſaid Fine,</hi> and the iſſue in taile is privy, for he claimes as heire by diſcent, and if ſuch Fine ſhall barre, where the tenant in taile had nothing, though the iſſue enter after the death of the aunceſtor, before all the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations paſſe; <hi>a fortiori</hi> here, when tenant in taile, at the time was ſeiſed of an eſtate, though 'twere in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. See <hi>Archers caſe,</hi> where a Fine ſhall barre the iſſue, where the Father had onely a poſſibility at the time of the Fine levied.</p>

P. &amp; T. and dyed in Auguſt next, his daughter (being heire to the taile) and her huſband brought a <hi>Formedon,</hi> and, pending the plea, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations paſſed, and 'twas agreed by the Court, that the tenant ſhall plead the Fine, and the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations which paſſed pending the Writ, &amp; ſhall barre the demandant, yet, there the iſſue did all that might be done; for the conveyance is the Fine, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, are but a ſhort repetition of the Fine; out of this, foure things are to be obſerved. 1. Though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fine, a right deſcends to the iſſue, yet, after Proclamations, the right is barred. 2.

Reſolved, that the iſſue was not Remitted, but barred by 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Though the eſtate was avoyded, before all the Proclamations paſſed.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, though the iſſue be beyond the Sea, yet, becauſe he is privy, &amp;c. he is bound, as if he he were within age, covert, or <hi>non compos.</hi> Which was agreed by all the Juſtices: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the claime of the iſſue is not materiall, and if Infancy, &amp;c. ſhould avoyde the Fine, no man ſhould be aſſured of land conveyed.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42741:60"/> after the marriage for life, &amp;c. for a competent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the wife; then 27. transferred the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the uſe, and if further proviſion had not been, the wives ſhould have their dowers and joyntures alſo; and therefore thoſe branches were made in the ſame Statute of 27.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that the Feoffement to the uſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for life, the remainder to his wife for life, for the joynture of the wife, is within 27. for though that five eſtates onely are expreſſed. 1. To the husband and wife, and the heires of the husband. 2. &amp;c. to the heires of their two bodies. 3. Of the body of one of them. 4. For their lives. 5. To the husband and wife for life of the wife, yet, many other eſtates are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Act, for theſe are put for example, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude others: But reſolved, that no eſtate is a joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, except it takes beginning preſently after the death of the husband; for ſo, are all the examples: and therefore to himſelfe for life, the remainder to B. for life, the remainder to his wife, &amp;c. is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute, &amp;c. And therefore though the wife enter and takes the profits, ſhe ſhall have Dower. An eſtate to one and his wife, and the heires males of their two bodies, adjudged a good joynture, yet none of the five eſtates mentioned; an eſtate made to a woman for life, before marriage, adjudged a good joynture.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, though the eſtate here were upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and though Dower (in place of which the joynture comes) were abſolute, yet becauſe an eſtate for life upon condition, is an eſtate for life, 'tis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the words, and the intent of the Act, if the wife ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that a wife cannot waive a joynture made before the coverture, as ſhe may a joynture made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and this by the <hi>Proviſo</hi> (if any woman hath lands,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42741:60"/> &amp;c. aſſured after marriage for her life, &amp;c. after death of the husband ſhe hath liberty to refuſe, &amp;c.) and therefore the intent of the Statute, was, that ſhe ſhould not refuſe a joynture made before, and land conveyed for part of her joynture, or in ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of part of her Dower, is no barre of any part, for the incertainty; for the Statute ſays, for the joynture of the wifes, and not for part of the joynture.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that though the eſtate of the wife be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an expreſſe condition, for to performe the will, which imports a conſideration of making the eſtate, yet, it may be averred for joynture, for the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration well ſtands with the other, and though it be not expreſſed in the Deed, yet, it may be averred: and the caſe is the ſtronger, becauſe the averment is given by the words of the Act. And a Fee ſimple to the wife, in ſatisfaction of her Dower, is a joynture within the equity of 27. for the reaſons aforeſaid, as alſo becauſe 'tis within the expreſſe words <hi>(for terme of life, or otherwiſe)</hi> for all eſtates as beneficiall, or more, are within, by this word <hi>otherwiſe in joynture,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgement was given againſt the demandant.</p>
               <p>A deviſe to a wife for life, in taile, &amp;c. for her joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a good joynture within 27. as 'twas reſolved in <hi>Leake</hi> and <hi>Randalls caſe.</hi> Otherwiſe, where a man deviſes to his wife for life, &amp;c. generally, this cannot be averred to be for joynture, and therefore no barre of Dower. 1. Becauſe a deviſe imports a conſideration in it ſelfe, and ſhall be taken as a benevolence. 2. All the will for land by 32. &amp; 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. ought to be in writing, and no averrement ought to be taken out of the will, which cannot be collected by the words within; an eſtate before marriage is within the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Statute; ſo an eſtate by deviſe, which takes effect after the marriage diſſolved is within 27.</p>

               <p>TEnant by Homage, Fealty, and Eſcuage, and ſuite to Court twice a yeare; the Lord was ſeiſed of the Fealty onely by the hands of the tenant. Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſeiſin of Fealty, was a ſeiſin of all the ſaid ſervices; for when the tenant doth fealty, he takes a corporall oath, that he ſhall be faithfull and true to the Lord, and ſhall beare him faith of the tenements, which he claimes to hold of him, and that he will lawfully doe the cuſtomes and ſervices, &amp;c. And though Homage be more honourable, and the moſt humble ſervice, that a Freeholder can doe to his Lord, yet, Fealty is the more ſacred ſervice, for this is done upon oath, not the other. And the words <hi>(ſhall be faithfull, and true)</hi> are alſo parcell of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; and Seiſin of any part of any ſervice, is a Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin of the whole, and the Law, for this reaſon, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects theſe ſervices, that no diſtreſſe for them, ſhall be exceſſive, and though diſtreſſe be ſo often, that the tenant cannot manure his land, he ſhall not have an Aſſiſe, as for rent, or other profits.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that ſeiſin of a ſuperior ſervice, is a ſeiſin of all inferior ſervices incident to it, as a ſeiſin of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuage, of homage and fealty, homage of fealty, rent of fealty, where the Seigniory is by fealty, and rent. Reſolved that doing of homage, is a ſeiſin of all ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces inferior and ſuperior, becauſe he takes upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to doe all ſervices. Reſolved, that ſeiſin of rent or ſuite, or of other annuall ſervice, is ſeiſin of eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, homage, fealty, ward, releife, heriot ſervice, ſervice for to cover the hall of the chiefe houſe of the Mannor, for to impale the Parke of the Lord or ſuch caſuall ſervices, which perchance will not fall in ſixty yeares, but ſeiſin of one annuall ſervice is not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42741:61"/> ſeiſin of another annuall ſervice, as rent, of ſuite nor of worke dayes, for 'tis the folly of the Lord, that he attained not ſeiſin, and it ſhould be miſcheivous to the tenant, for perhaps in ancient time the worke dayes are diſcharged, which now cannot be ſhewne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note (Reader)</hi> all this is to be intended of a ſeiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in Law, for ſeiſin of fealty here, is no actuall ſeiſin of homage, nor of ſuite, nor fealty of rent, but ſeiſin of any part of a ſervice, is an actuall ſeiſin of all to have an Aſſiſe. And as to make a vowry ſeiſin in Law ſuffices; but for an Aſſiſe actuall ſeiſin is requiſite; ſo in a Writ of right of Land. See the Booke at large, and there, where ancient ſeiſin to an eſtate altered, or changed from one perſon to another, ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient where not.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that ſeiſin in Law was ſufficient to make an avowry within the letter, and the intent of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the intent was to limit a time, within which, ſeiſin ought to be had, not to exclude any ſeiſin, which was a lawfull ſeiſin by the common Law, which appeares by the Preamble. Alſo, the former acts of limitation as <hi>W.</hi> 1. <hi>ca'.</hi> 38. <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>ca'.</hi> 2. doe not exclude a ſeiſin ſufficient at common Law. And the Statute ſaith <hi>(Actuall poſſeſſion, or ſeiſin)</hi> which <hi>(Seiſin)</hi> is eyther actuall or in Law.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that the act doth not extend to ſuch a rent or ſervice, which by common poſſibility cannot happen within ſixty yeares, as homage, fealty, for the tenant may live beyond, or to cover the Hall, or to goe in Warre, ſo of a <hi>Formedon in Diſcender,</hi> for tenant in taile may live ſixty yeares, after diſcontinuance, and though <hi>In facto</hi> he dyes, and the iſſue doth not purſue his <hi>Formedon,</hi> yet, he may have it at any time, and the ſeiſin of the donee was not traverſable, ſo of homage and other caſuall ſervices, though the Lord might have had ſeiſin. So, if the Lord releaſe to the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42741:62"/> tenant, ſo long as I. S. hath heires of his body, though ſixty yeares paſſe, yet he may diſtraine, for <hi>Impotentia excuſat legem,</hi> and there may be a tenure by homage, &amp;c. and yet never done, as if the Land be conveyed to a Maior, &amp;c. or other Corporation aggregate of many, they hold by fealty, yet they cannot doe it. A Writ of Eſcheate, <hi>Ceſſavit, Reſcous,</hi> are not within the Act, for in them the ſeiſin is not traverſable, but the tenure, and in the Eſcheate and <hi>Ceſſavit,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Land and can lay no ſeiſin, and the Act ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends onely to thoſe Writs where the demandant or his Anceſtors might have had ſeiſin. So, <hi>Note,</hi> Land ſhall eſcheate, though there be no ſeiſin of the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, within the time of limitation, for the Seigniory remaines, though ſeiſin wants; ſo if the tenant ceſſe, and the Land be not overt, and ſufficient to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe the Lord ſhall have a <hi>Ceſſavit</hi> though he wants ſeiſin of the ſervices. Reſolved, if nothing be arreare and the Lord diſtraines, the tenant may make reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, or if he be ſo often diſtrained, that he cannot manure his Land, he may have an Aſſiſe, <hi>De ſouent diſtres,</hi> but for ſuch tortious diſtreſſe where nothing is arreare, the tenant ſhall not have Treſpaſſe, <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> againſt the Lord, for this is prohibited by the Statute of <hi>Marleb ca'</hi> 3. See the Booke at large in what caſe an incroachment of more rent by the Lord then he ought to have, ſhall be avoyded, in what not.</p>
               <p>Reſolved, that though a man hath beene out of poſſeſſion of Land by ſixty yeares, yet if his entry be not taken away, he may enter, and bring any poſſeſſory action of his owne poſſeſſion, for the firſt clauſe doth not barre any right, but prohibits that none ſhall have a Writ of right, &amp;c. of the poſſeſſion of his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, &amp;c. but onely of a ſeiſin within ſixty yeares; the firſt and ſecond clauſe extend onely to ſeiſin aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtrell;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42741:62"/> the third to an action of his owne poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to entry, the fourth to avowry, the fifth to a <hi>Formedon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note (Reader)</hi> out of this, that when the tenant hath done homage and fealty, which the Lord may inforce him to doe, this ſhall be a ſeiſin of all other ſervices, as to avowry, though the Lord nor thoſe by whom he claimes had ſeiſin within ſixty yeares.</p>

                  <p>The commencement of common appendant by the ancient Law, was in this manner, <hi>(viz.)</hi> When a Lord of a Mannor infeoffed another of arrable Lands, to hould of him in Soccage, <hi>(id eſt) per ſervicium ſocae</hi> the Feoffee <hi>ad maintenand' ſervicium ſocae</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the waſts of the Lord for his neceſſary beaſts that did plowe and ayre his Lands, and this common, is of common right, and commenceth by operation of the Law, and in favour of tillage, and therefore it needeth not to preſcribe in that, for ſo it is houlden 4. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. <hi>H.</hi> 6. as one ought if it were againſt common right. But it is onely appendant to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient arrable Lands, and onely for oxen, horſes, kyne, and ſheepe, &amp;c. And becauſe it is againſt the nature of common appendant to be appendant to meadowe or paſture, and becauſe that here, the preſcription was to have common time out of minde to a houſe, meadow, and paſture, as well as to arrable, by which it appeares to the Court, that there hath been a houſe, meadow, and paſture, time out of minde, 'twas reſolved that this common was appurtenant, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant. But if of latter times, men have builded upon ſome part of ſuch arrable Lands, and ſome part thereof is imployed to meadow and paſture; and this for maintenance of tillage (the originall cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) the common remaines appendant, and it ſhall be intended in reſpect of the continuall uſage of the common for beaſts leavant and couchant upon ſuch lands, that at the beginning all was arrable. But in pleading he ought to preſcribe that the ſame is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant to Land, for though <hi>terra dicitur a terrendo, quia vomere territur,</hi> yet <hi>(terra)</hi> includes all, and is arrable, though converted to meadow, &amp;c. For it may be plowed.</p>
                  <p>A man may preſcribe to have common appendant to his Mannor, for all the demeanes ſhall be intended
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42741:79"/> arrable; at leaſt, in conſtruction of Law <hi>(redd'. ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula ſingulis)</hi> it ſhall be appendant to ſuch demeanes which are ancient arrable, &amp;c. And when a man claimes common appendant to his Mannor, no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity appeares of his own ſhewing, as here. So com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon may be appendant to a Carve of land, which may containe paſture, meadow, and wood, but it ſhall be applyed to that, which agrees with the nature of the common.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, that common appendant may be appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, becauſe 'tis of common right; for if a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner purchaſe part of the Lands, in which he hath common, yet the common ſhall be apportioned, as well as if the Lord purchaſe parcell, of the tenancy the rent ſhall be apportioned. And if A. a commoner enfeoffe B. of parcell of his ancient Lands, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſhall be apportioned, and B. ſhall have common <hi>pro rata.</hi> And 'twas agreed, that ſuch common which is admeaſurable, remaines after ſeverance of part of the land, to which, &amp;c. But here, for that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was appurtenant, 'twas adjudged, that by the purchaſe, all was extinct, for 'twas againſt common right; for, by the act of the parties, it cannot be in <hi>eſſe</hi> for part, and extinct for part.</p>
                  <p>'Twas ſaid that <hi>pertinens</hi> is the Latine word as well for appurtenant as appendant, and therefore <hi>ſubjecta materia,</hi> and the circumſtances ought to direct the Court to adjudge the common, appurtenant, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant.</p>

                  <p>Reſolved, that where the verdict was entered three termes paſt, and in the Roll the demiſe to B. for ſix yeares was not enterd to be by Indenture, that the Roll ſhall be mended, becauſe the note of the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all verdict, which the Jury exhibited to the Court, remaining with the Secondary, purports that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry found the demiſe prout; by which it doth appeare to the Court, that the demiſe was ſhewne in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and reference made by the note to it; and ſo 'twas in <hi>Gomerſalls caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reſolved, though the condition is of two parts in the diſ-junctive, for non-payment of rent, or of the ſumme in groſſe, yet, if A. had redemiſed any part of the houſe to C. and C. enters, by which the rent is ſuſpended, that all the condition as well for the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall ſumme, as for the rent is alſo ſuſpended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the condition is intire, and cannot be divided by the act of the parties. Reſolved, that if A. had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiſed any part to C. though C. never enters, the rent is ſuſpended, and though a ſtranger occupy it.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, that the leaſe by A. to B. for ſix yeares, though he had nothing at the time, was good by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion by the Indenture, and when C. redemiſed all to A. then was the intereſt bound with this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then when A. redemiſes to C. the Stable, C. is alſo concluded, for all parties and privies in eſtate or intereſt are bound by the Eſtoppell; then the caſe is no other, but that A. demiſes for ſix yeares the Stable to B and after demiſes to C. for twenty yeares (which is a good Leaſe in reverſion for fourteene yeares) this is no ſuſpenſion of the rent, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for 'tis no grant of the reverſion, but a future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in reverſion, no terme, but an intereſt of a terme, as the pleading is, and notwithſtanding ſuch grant, the reverſion is in the grantor, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnement, and he ſhall have the rent upon the firſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42741:85"/> leaſe, but if there be an atturnement, the reverſion paſſes, and ſuſpenſion will follow.

                  <p n="4">4.

But 'twas objected, that the Land was not given to the finding of a Prieſt, for he had but a penſion out of it, and the Statute is, that the King ſhall have in as large, &amp;c. as the Prieſt had it. 2.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Land of 20. <hi>l. per an.</hi> is given to find a Prieſt, with 10. <hi>l.</hi> thereof, and that the other ten pound ſhall be to the Poore, the King ſhall have but ten pound, but if it be for finding of a Preiſt, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of Poore Men, without limitting how much the Prieſt ſhal have, the King ſhall have the Land for otherwiſe he ſhall have nothing. 3. If Land of 20. <hi>l.</hi> is given for finding Sallary for a Prieſt with 10. <hi>l.</hi> of it, and alſo a good uſe is limitted, there the King ſhall have but ten pound, although that other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are to be found for the Prieſt, becauſe a good uſe in certaine ſhall be preferred before a ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42741:95"/> incertaine uſe; but if nothing in certaine be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Preiſt, the King ſhall have the Land. 4. If Land be given to find a Prieſt the King ſhall have it, but if a Prieſt have but a ſtipend, the King ſhall have but the ſtipend. 5. When a certaine ſumme is limitted to a Prieſt, and other good uſes are alſo limitted, which depend upon the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſe, all is given to the King. 6. If all the uſes be ſuperſtitious, of what certainty ſoever they are, the land is given to the King, otherwiſe it is, if there be any good uſe, and as to that which was objected, that the King ſhall have no more then the Prieſt. It was anſwered, that that extends to the 1.2. and 4.

                  <p>A Leſſee doth Covenant for himſelfe, his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and Adminiſtrators, with the Leſſor,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42741:101"/> that he, his Executors or Aſſignes ſhall build a Brick Wall upon parcell of the Land demiſed, &amp;c. after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Leſſee aſſignes over his tearme to B. in this Caſe B. is not bound to build the Wall.</p>
                  <p>When the Covenant extends to a thing <hi>In eſſe,</hi> parcell of the demiſe, then the thing to be done by force of the Covenant, is, <hi>Quodammodo,</hi> annexed and appurtenant to the thing demiſed, and ſhall run with the Land, and binde the Aſſignee, although he be not bound by expreſſe Covenant. But when the Covenant extends to a thing which had not eſſence, at the time of the demiſe made, that cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenant, or annexed to a thing which had not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. As if a Leſſee Covenant to repaire the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to him, demiſed during the tearme, this is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the contract, &amp;c. and ſhall bind the Aſſignee, although he be not bound expreſly by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. But in this Caſe, the Covenant concernes a thing which had not eſſence at the time of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but to be made after, and therefore it ſhall binde the Covenantor, his Executors and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators, and not the aſſignee, for the Law will not annexe the Covenant to a thing which had not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. It was reſolved in this Caſe, if the Leſſee had Covenanted for him and his aſſignes, &amp;c. that in as much as it was to be builded upon the thing demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it ſhould binde the aſſignee, by expreſſe words. Alſo, if a warranty be to one, his Heires and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes by expreſſe words, the aſſignee ſhall take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite thereof, and have a <hi>Warrantia cartae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But although the Covenant be for him and his Aſſignes, yet if the thing to be done be meerly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall to the Land demiſed, and doe not concerne the ſame, the Aſſignee ſhall not be charged as if the Leſſee Covenant for him and his Aſſignes to build a houſe upon the Land of the Leſſor, which is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42741:101"/> of the demiſe, or to pay any collaterall Summe of money to the Leſſor, or to a ſtranger, this ſhall not binde the Aſſignee. Alſo in a caſe of goods, as Sheepe, Chattell, &amp;c. there is not any privity or reverſion in the Aſſignee, but meerely a thing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the perſonalty, which cannot binde any but the Covenantor, his Executors or adminiſtrators, which doe repreſent him. The ſame Law is, if a man demiſe Lands for yeares with a ſtock of Cattle, or Summe of money rendring rent, and the Leſſee Covenants for him, his Executors, Adminiſtrators, and Aſſignes to deliver the Stock of Cattle, or the Summe of money, at the end of the Terme, yet the Aſſignee ſhall not be charged with the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>This word <hi>(Conceſſi)</hi> or <hi>(Demiſi)</hi> imports a Covenant, and if an Aſſignee of a Leſſee be evicted, he may have a Writ of Covenant, ſo ſhall Tenant by Statute, or <hi>Elegit</hi> of a Terme, or he to whom the Leaſe is ſould by force of any Execution, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If a man grant to a Leſſee for yeares, that he ſhall have ſo many eſtovers, as ſhall ſerve to repaire his Houſe, or that he ſhall burne within his Houſe, or ſuch like during the Tearme, that is appurtenant to the Land, and ſhall run with the ſame as a thing appurtenant, in whoſe hands ſoever the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</p>

Exception to the verdict, that the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Verdict vary, for the Indictment is, that the arreſt was by precept and by Verdict, it is found that it was by cuſtome without precept. Anſwered, that the precept is but circumſtance, and varience in it is not materiall, having found the ſubſtance, as if the Indictment be, that he killed him with a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and it is found that it was with a Sword, ſo if he be indicted of murder, and it is found man-ſlaughter, this is good; for <hi>Ex malitia</hi> is but circumſtance. 2. The Indictment may be generall, <hi>Ex malitia,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe the Law imployeth malice, and ſo the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept not materiall. 2. The cuſtome is not good, to arreſt one without ſummons: it is good, and if the proceſſe be erroneous, yet killing of him who did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute it, is murder, becauſe he is not to diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or not, and if any officer in doing his office be ſlaine, this is murder, and in ſuch a caſe an officer is not bound to flie to the Wall, as another is. 3.

               <p n="5">5. It is not found that the killing was fellony. <hi>Reſp.</hi> It is ſufficient for the Jurors, to find the killing, which is the ſubſtance, and leave it to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Court if it be fellony.</p>

               <p>IT was adjudged, that an Action of the Caſe, will lye againſt Executors, for a Debt due by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator upon a ſimple contract. An Action upon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſit, made by the Teſtator, was maintainable, againſt the Executors, upon a contract for Corne. <hi>Norwood &amp; Reades Caſe, plow: com.</hi> 181.</p>
               <p>Debts upon ſimple contracts ought to be paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Legacies, and reaſonable part of the goods of the Wife or Infant, which proveth that they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine; the Spirituall Court doth give remedy for payment of Legacies; and the reaſon of all this is, for that the Teſtator in his life time, upon his action of the caſe upon the aſſumpſit, might not wage his Law, as he might have done upon his action of debt; for no action is maintainable againſt Executors, where the Teſtator might have waged his Law in his life time: If a Priſoner doe eate and drinke with his Goaler, and dye, the Goaler ſhall have an action of debt againſt his Executors, for the meate and drinke of the Teſtator; and the reaſon is, for that in this caſe the Teſtator might not wage his Law, as is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, 27. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 46. in <hi>Thomas Bodulgates</hi> Caſe, and the reaſon that no wager of Law in this Caſe is, becauſe that every Goaler ought to keep his Priſoner <hi>in ſalva &amp; arcta cuſtodia,</hi> and thereby the Goaler is in a manner compelled to finde Victualls for his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and therefore the Priſoner may not wage his Law; but if A. contract with B. for his commons for a moneth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there, in an action of debt brought againſt A. he may wage Law.</p>
               <p>If a Victualer, or common Innkeeper bring an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of debt for victualls delivered to his Gueſt, the Gueſt may wage his Law; for the Victualler, or Hoſt,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:42741:188"/> is not compellable to deliver Victualls untill he be paid for them in hand, 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7, 8. in <hi>Anno.</hi> 4. <hi>H.</hi> 6. R. G. brought an Action of Debt for 10. Markes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Thomas Timberhull,</hi> and others, Executors of <hi>William Webb,</hi> and declared that the Teſtator had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein'd the Plaintiffe to be with him for a yeare in the Art of Limming of Books, paying <hi>per annum</hi> 10. Markes: And <hi>Martin</hi> did hold opinion, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was not maintainable againſt Executors, and he tooke diverſity between this Caſe of a Limmer, and of a common Labourer, for the Labourer may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled in ſpight of his head to ſerve, and his wage is put in certeinty by the Statute, and it is no reaſon the Servant ſhould looſe his wages by the death of their Maſter, whom he was bound by the Law to ſerve, but in caſe of a Limmer he is not bound by the Law to ſerve, &amp; ſo when he makes a Covenant it is his owne Act and folly, and not the Act of the Law, for he might have taken a ſpecialty, and the opinion of <hi>Martin</hi> in this Caſe, is good Law: But the true reaſon of this diverſity, is, becauſe that in this Caſe of the common Labourer, the Teſtator might not wage his Law as he might againſt the Lymmer, and this appeareth in 11. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fol.</hi> 48. where the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of <hi>Freres Minors</hi> in <hi>Coventry,</hi> brought an Action of Debt againſt <hi>John Burton</hi> of <hi>Coventry,</hi> Executor of <hi>John Goate,</hi> and declared that the ſaid <hi>John Goate</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd at <hi>Coventry, Frere John Bredon,</hi> a Brother of the ſaid Houſe by Licenſe of the ſaid Gardian, to Sing for him Maſſes for one whole yeare, and to ſay Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> Trentalls in the next yeare after, and ſhewed in certainty upon what ſervices Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall did conſiſt, taking for this, xl.<hi>s. per annum,</hi> and within foure dayes <hi>John Goate</hi> dyed, and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant his Executor, and the ſaid <hi>John Burton,</hi> granted to the ſaid <hi>Frere</hi> to pay him the ſaid Summe, for
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:42741:189" rendition="simple:additions"/> doing the ſaid ſervices according to the Reteinor of the Teſtator, which Divine ſervices the <hi>Frere</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme according to the reteinor, and all his wages were Arr. And in this Caſe the diverſity was taken, that a Labourer may have an Action of Debt againſt Executors, without ſpecialty, becauſe that he may be compelled to ſerve by the Statute, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator ſhall not wage his Law in this Caſe. But the Prieſt or Frere is not bound to Sing Maſſes, by the Law, againſt his will. And in every Caſe where the Teſtator might have waged his Law, the Action is not maintainable againſt his Executors without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty, for Executors may not wage the Law, upon the contract of another. In 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 16. <hi>Lawr.</hi> Saint <hi>Martin</hi> retained one for Tearme of his life, in the time of peace and Warres for 100 <hi>s. per annum,</hi> which ſervice hee (as his Servant) did doe for two yeares, for which he brought his Action of Debt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>John Belton,</hi> and others, Executors of the ſaid <hi>Lawr.</hi> And judgement was given againſt the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe, for the reaſon, and upon the ſame diverſity, as is aforeſaid; an Aſſumpſit without ſpecialty is no more perſonall then a Covenant by ſpecialty, and therefore dyeth not with the perſon.</p>

               <p>Two matters of record amount to an Office, as in the Caſe of Sir <hi>John Savage,</hi> who was Sheriffe of the County of <hi>Worceſter</hi> for life, by Letters Patents under the Great Seale, and was Indicted of two voluntary eſcapes of Fellons: and the King may ſeize his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice into his owne hands, without ſuing forth any <hi>Scire facias,</hi> 5. <hi>Mar.

               <p>The Abbey of <hi>Crowland</hi> had a Gaole and Priſoners, and for that hee once deteined men that were quit of Fellony, the King reſeiſed the Gaole for ever.</p>

               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="5">5. A Corporation may be without head, as if the K. incorporate a Towne, and give to them power to chooſe a Maior, they are a Corporation before Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is a ſufficient incorporation that there be an Hoſpitall poteſtate, for the Temple was a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 1. and yet was not built till <hi>H.</hi> 2. time, but here the Houſe was built before.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

This by her death goeth to her Executors, therefore it may be extinguiſhed by her, if the diſſeiſſee releaſe all actions to the diſſeiſſor, who dyes, the diſſeiſſee ſhall have a Writ of entry againſt his Heire, or if Bailor releaſe all Actions to the Bailee, he ſhall have adetinue againſt his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. 5.

Reſolv. if a man ſeiſed of three acres of equall value, one holden in <hi>Capite,</hi> and giveth that and one of the other to his younger Sonne in taile, he cannot deviſe any part of the third Acre, becauſe he had executed his power, and if he purchaſe other Land in ſocage, he can deviſe but two parts of that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his reverſion in <hi>Capite,</hi> expectant upon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate taile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> that the K. was once ſatisfied of the wardſhip by the Statute, in reſpect of the Acre hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and the reverſion thereupon ſhall not hinder the deviſe of Land, purchaſed after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſtatute doth not regard this ſeck reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but inheritances of annuall value. <hi>Reſp.</hi> To the firſt, that this reverſion ſhall hinder the deviſe, by the words of the Statute, for he had a reverſion of Lands holden, but although the Statute ſaith, that he may alien two parts, by act executed or will, if he alien to one of the three uſes by act executed, he may deviſe the reverſion, for the Statute is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of an intire Alienation, and where the Statute ſaith in reverſion or remainder, it is to be intended, that the deviſor be ſeiſed of ſuch a remainder which drawes wardſhip.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond it was anſwered, that things which of their nature are ſeck are out of the Statute, but not things which of their nature are of annuall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, but are not of value in reſpect of ſome Leaſe or gift, <hi>Abſ<expan>

                     </expan> abliquo inde reddendo,</hi> and therefore ſeck re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions are deviſable by the ſaid Statutes; but if they be not, yet they ſhall hinder the deviſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lands: To make one able to deviſe by thoſe Statutes the time of Having, Holding, and diſpoſing, muſt concurre, and therefore if a grant to the ſecond Sonne here, had beene in fee, although with power of revocation, the deviſe had been good, becauſe he
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:42741:205"/> had no Lands <hi>In Capite,</hi> at the time of the deviſe, if the Father conveyeth his Land to the uſe of his younger Sonne, the eldeſt being within age, after the death of his Father, he ſhall be in ward although nothing diſcend: A true Child, and not in reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is within the Statute, and if the Sonne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Land <hi>Bona fide,</hi> of his Father, this is out of the Statute, becauſe it is not for his advancement; If Tenant in ſocage deviſe, and after purchaſe Land in Chivalry, the deviſe is void for a third part, but if Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in Chivalry and ſocage deviſe all, and after aliens the Land holden, this is good. To make diviſion, that the King ſhall have a third part holden, the Lands ſhall be taken according to their value at the time of the death of the Deviſor. The time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that a third part muſt diſcend, needs not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with the time of alienation, but it is ſufficient that he had it at the time of his death. The eſtate to any of the three purpoſes ought to continue to the time of death, and the Tenure muſt till after death, to make it within the Statute, and the eſtate alſo of Lands holden, ought to continue after death, therefore if Tenant in taile, in <hi>Capite</hi> deviſe ſocage Land, and dye without iſſue, this is good, ſo privity muſt continue after death, therefore if he who made the conveyance be attainted, this is out of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: The uſes to the ſecond Sonne are in contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and not executed by 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. by the power to make Leaſes, and deviſe reſerved to the feoffor, and therefore the fee is in the feoffor in the meane time, ſo that having diſpoſed of it, and being ſeiſed of it, he cannot deviſe the Land purchaſed after.</p>
               <p>It was Objected, that the Statute ſaith, lawfully executed in his life, but here no uſe was to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in the ſecond Sonne untill after his death.</p>
               <p>It was Anſwered, that after his death the uſes
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:42741:205"/> were derived out of the feoffement, and ſo are as it were executed in his life.</p>
               <p>It was holden by the Chiefe Juſtice, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to the ſecond Sonne is contingent, in regard no alienation is found to be made by the Eldeſt, and if there had been, then it would be repugnant, that after alienation the Land ſhould remaine to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sonne, and ſo <hi>Quacunq, via data,</hi> the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (as this Caſe is) cannot veſt in him, but this point was not reſolved by the Court. 2. The revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is good, although the Indenture precedeth the feoffement, and that the uſes are in contingency, and that the revocation is but in part, and the Chiefe Juſtice held, that the Eldeſt Sonne had but a terme determinable, and the ſecond an eſtate taile; But in this, the Kings Bench and Common pleas differ in Opinion, and that if Lands be deviſed to one and the Heires of his body for 500. yeares, the Executors ſhall have it, and not the Heire, and the deviſee may alien it, for it cannot be intailed, and ſo in <hi>Peacocks</hi> Caſe, 28. <hi>Eliz.

               <p>It was anſwered, that colour ſhall not be given, for colour ſhall not be given where the plea goeth to the barre of the right, for it would be in vaine to give colour of right, and to barre him if he had right, as if a collaterall warranty, fine, Statute be pleaded, or if he claimes by a waife, otherwiſe where he pleads a diſcent, for this doth not barre the right, but the poſſeſſion; he who claimes by ſale in a Market overt, ſhall not give colour if he pleads generally, but if he pleads that I.

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42741:206"/> (that which reſpectively to them belongs) ſhall judge of the ſufficiency thereof, therefore a deed ſhall not be ſuffered to be given in evidence, by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, or Copy except it be burned or ſome ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, but a Copy of a record is good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: if a releaſe be made to Tenant for life, this inureth to the reverſioner, yet he cannot pleade it without ſhewing, a <hi>Fortiori,</hi> here becauſe the Leſſee may contract with the Leſſor, to ſuffer him to have the deed to ſhew, but Strangers who claime not the thing granted, nor intereſt out of it, need not to ſhew the deed, otherwiſe if he claimes the thing granted, or intereſt out of it; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the ſecond grantee of a rent charge muſt ſhew the firſt grant, but he who claimes as Gardian, or meerly by the Law, without privity or power of providing the deed need not to ſhew it: But Tenant by the courteſie muſt ſhew it, becauſe the deed was in his power living the Wife, otherwiſe of Tenant by Statute. &amp;c.</p>

               <p n="3">3. It was Objected that the feoffement of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainee diſplaceth the remainder, ſo that the warranty which diſcends upon him, barreth him: But reſolv. that the warranty doth not bind him.</p>

               <p>Firſt that the Obligation was not within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, becauſe that the Statute extended onely to ſuch Obligations which any who is in their ward did make unto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the ſame Obligation was not void at the Common Law, whereupon the Plaintiffe had judgment, and another judgement 28 <hi>El. Inter Burwey

               <p>Now it is ſaid in the later clauſe of the Act, that if any of the Sheriffs or other Officers or Miniſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, take any Obligation in other forme, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their Offices, that it ſhould be void, &amp;c. There are two manner of formes, <hi>(Viz.) Forma verbalis &amp; forma legalis,</hi> for <hi>Verbalis</hi> ſtands upon the Letters and Sillables of the Act, <hi>Forma legalis,</hi> is <hi>Forma eſſentialis,</hi> and ſtands upon the ſubſtance of the thing to be done, and upon the ſence of the Statute, <hi>Quia notitia ramorum hujus Statuti, non in ſermonum folijs ſed in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis radice poſita eſt,</hi> and according to this diſtinction this Branch of this Statute is to be expounded, and therefore in 37. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 1. If the Sheriffe take a ſingle Obligation of one in his ward that was bailable, this was void, for this Obligation wants eſſentiall forme, preſcribed by the Statute; for the condition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the fault, which is part of the ſubſtance. And there <hi>Moyle</hi> ſaid, that if the Sheriffe let one to Baile or Mainpriſe, that is excepted in the Statute, and not mainpernable, and take a ſimple Obligation, that the ſame is void, <hi>Quod alij Juſticiarij conceſſerunt,</hi> for by the exception it appeareth, that it was not the intention of the Statute, that ſuch ſhould be let to Baile, and therefore the Obligation is taken in another ſence then the Statute intends. And it ſeemeth to me, that as well in the ſame Caſe of 37. <hi>H.</hi> 6. as in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Caſe of <hi>Dive</hi> and <hi>Manningham, plow.</hi> 67. the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which hath the condition to ſave the Sheriffe harmeleſſe (when the Sheriffe againſt the Law let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth one to Baile who is not Baileable) is againſt the Law, and void by the Common Law. And with this accordeth <hi>William Wiſhams</hi> Caſe, 15. <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi> 324. &amp; in 7. <hi>E.</hi> 4. One was in cuſtody of the Sheriffe
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42741:208"/> by force of a <hi>Capias,</hi> upon an Indictment of the Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and the party maketh the Obligation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the direction of the Sheriffe, upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as the Statute preſcribes for the ſuerty of the Sheriffe, &amp;c. and there it is holden that the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is void, becauſe the Statute preſcribes, that the Obligation ſhall be made to the Sheriffe, and that is part of the eſſentiall forme; and ſo, if the Sheriffe add to the condition, that he ſhall be kept harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe againſt the King and the Plaintiffe, &amp;c. this is void, ſo if a Gaoler or a Sheriffe take an Obligation of the perſon, with condition to be true Priſoner or to pay for his meat and drinke. So if the Sheriffe add any other thing to the matter preſcribed by the Statute, as to pay ſuch a Sum of money for a Horſe, &amp;c. This condition maketh all the Obligation void, for it is taken in another forme (touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the matter,) then is preſcribed by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, but in <hi>Paſche</hi> 27. <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench, in an Action of Debt brought by Sir <hi>William Drury,</hi> late Sheriffe of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> upon an Obligation of 20. <hi>l.</hi> againſt A.

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:42741:209"/> two Sureties at the leaſt, and the Plurall number cannot be ſatisfied with the Singular number, and ſo contrary to the words of the Statute. And ſo was the Opinion of <hi>Mountegue</hi> Chiefe Juſtice of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Place in the Caſe of <hi>Dive</hi> and <hi>Manningham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo, in the condition that the Priſoner ſhould appeare in perſon, where the words of the Statute are, that he ſhould appeare (generally) without theſe words (in perſon.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he ſhould appeare at the day, &amp;c. <hi>Ad reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondendum,</hi> where theſe words <hi>Ad reſpondendum</hi> are more then the Statute preſcribes, and therefore the Obligation is void, &amp;c. but it was reſolved by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wray,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Gaudy,</hi> and all the Court, that the Obligation was not void, by the ſaid Act.</p>
               <p>For to the firſt; The words reaſonable ſurety of ſufficient perſons are added for the ſurety of the Sheriffe, and therefore if he will but take one ſurety, be it at his perill, for he ſhall be amerced if the Defendants appeare not; and therefore the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute doth not make void the Obligation in this Caſe, for the ſame Branch that requires the forme, requires alſo that the Obligation ſhall be made to the Sheriffe himſelfe, by the name of his Office, and that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſhould appeare, in which clauſe no mention is made of the ſureties, ſo as the intent of the Act was, that in ſo much as it was at the perill of the Sheriffe to leave to his diſcretion, to take one or more for his indemnity, and although the ſureties have not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient within the ſame County as the Statute menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth, yet the Obligation is good: For theſe words of the Act, (as to this point) are more for councell or direction of the Sheriffe, then for precept or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to him, and that for the ſafety of the Sheriffe, for if the Defendant cannot find two ſufficient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, having ſufficient within the ſame County, the

               <p n="3">3. A thing in poſſeſſion cannot be parcell of a reverſion upon an eſtate for life, but Trees which grow out of the Land, and Fiſh or Deer in the Land may, and ſhall paſſe with it.</p>

               <p n="5">5. In the Caſe at Barr by exception of the Trees power is reſerved to the leſſor, or his ſervants, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſhow the Trees to the Vendee: <hi>Cuicunque a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquis quid concedit, concedere videtur &amp; id, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The Plea is double, one to the Writ, another to the Action.</p>
